Opinionated, no-bullshit, personal Neovim config made for my needs, but should be as well usable for other people. I made this for myself so I could code better, this is my best and most minimal Neovim config to date, because I am tired of over-complex frameworks.
Totsuka is focused on the base vim experience, with as minimal plugins as possible, some stuff here is not essential to users outside of myself, you are encouraged to take out and add as needed.
